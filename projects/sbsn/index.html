        <div class="body_text">
          <p>Location: Janakpur, Nepal</p>
          <p>Type: Interior</p>
          <p>Super built up area: 2100sqft</p>
          <p>Status: Ongoing</p>
        </div>

        <p class="body_text">
          The property is located in a dense neighborhood and has a long and
          narrow layout. The front side consists of the parking, living room,
          master bedroom, guest bedroom and a common toilet. Whereas the rear
          side has a kid&#39;s bedroom, common toilet, store room and the dining
          room sandwiched between the kitchen and puja room.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading__small">Concept</h3>
        <p class="body_text">
          The design was inspired by a very simple idea that we wanted to use
          traditional knowledge in relevance to today&#39;s context. The
          interior is contemporary and minimalistic yet you can find subtle
          touches of tradition and vernacular with lippan art which originates
          from the northern parts of India, weaved matts which adds texture to
          the furniture and interiors, Terrazzo flooring otherwise known as
          mosaic flooring which is one of the oldest types of flooring used. All
          these handmade features humanized the design with its imperfections
          and brought in a multi-layered feel to the space that were well
          amalgamated with the clean contemporary style of the interiors.
        </p>

        <p class="body_text">
          Since the weather in terai area of Nepal is hot and humid almost
          throughout the year the concept was to make the interiors feel cool
          and calm, hence cool tones of colors was used and the warmth was
          provided with the furniture and lighting. The pastel green shade with
          the teak wood Patti around the entire house gives a cohesive feel to
          the house, something that ties the entire space together. The
          remaining part of the wall and ceiling was painted in an off-white
          tone to give the feeling of spaciousness.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading__small">Floor Plan</h3>
        <p class="body_text">
          We decided to follow strict vastu principles. For example, the facing
          of WC and sink, facing north while sitting in the living room, Mirrors
          were placed only on east wall and position of beds was some of the
          vastu principles we followed while designing the layout of the ground
          floor.

        <h3 class="sub-heading__small">Living room</h3>
        <p class="body_text">
          We decided to opt out of using false ceiling and used plywood beams
          instead. It helped in maintaining the height as that was also one of
          the concerns of the client as the existing false ceiling was low. The
          rest of the interiors is kept simple and minimalistic with intricate
          details in terms of using materials and textures like the weaved matts
          we used for drawers.

        <p class="body_text">
          We went with similar colour tones that was used throughout the rest of
          the house. The headboard was made with a light powder pink terrazzo
          which complemented the pastel green walls.

        <h3 class="sub-heading__small">Dining and kitchen</h3>
        <p class="body_text">
          As we know the environment that we&#39;re surrounded by has a huge
          impact on our mental well- being. When you enter a space, you are
          immediately drawn to an opening or a window and you feel more open and
          calmer. Imagine living in a space with no windows or openings? Hence,
          the plan was to create a seamless connection with the outdoors as it
          would be one of the most used spaces. The rear part of the house was a
          challenge because of the narrow space being divided into three rooms
          and the ceiling being lower than the rest of the house which made the
          space feel small and congested. Hence, we went for an open plan where
          the dining and kitchen are connected. Large bifold doors were used
          which allowed the light to filter into the space. This made the dining
          space an enjoyable experience rather than feeling congested and also
          made for a great visual connect with the outdoor overlooking the
          gazebo. This was done also keeping in mind that it would act as a
          great entertainment space. It made the space feel larger and more
          welcoming.

        <h3 class="sub-heading__small">Garden</h3>
        <p class="body_text">
          The garden was designed such that it could be a place for
          entertainment or a place to relax and find tranquility in this
          extended space of your own. We wanted a seamless connection between
          the garden and the rest of the house. Hence similar shades of paint
          and textures and materials were used in the garden. The gazebo has a
          terracotta khapda(tile) roof which is locally made. It keeps the space
          cool throughout the day. The gazebo can be used for a small gathering
          or just be used to relax, do yoga, etc.
