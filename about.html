          <p>
            With environmental consciousness at its core, Earthen Karkhana is an architecture and design studio based in Nepal and
            India. A young firm with an old-school approach, we aim at fabricating structures which reflect a cohesive confluence of
            the old and new, by drawing inspiration from the traditional wisdom of design and construction to devise contemporary
            structures. Our primary endeavor is to create healthy spaces for the inhabitants by employing less toxic materials that
            are environmentally sound and user-friendly.
          </p>
          <blockquote><p>“No effort is ever wasted”</p></blockquote>
          <p>
            With an uptick in the climate-related disasters over the past decade, our team feels morally and socially obligated to
            play our personal role in creating built environments that are sustainable and responsible. Drawing on these lines,
            Earthen Karkhana focuses on providing holistic and eco-friendly design solutions that are practical, yet aesthetically
            tasteful.
            We also believe in the synergy of art and architecture, and hence collaborate with artisans and craftspeople to imbue
            hand-crafted textures, forms and articles into the modern spaces for creating a unique vocabulary and adding
            meaningfulness into the buildings.

          <h2 class="about__text--principal">Founder and Principal Architect</h2>
          <p>
            An ardent traveller and animal-lover at heart, along with being an adept artist and trekker by nature, Ar. Anusha Saraff
            is a little bit of everything. An alumna of M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology (Bangalore), her penchant for
            sustainable architecture stems from her inherent compassion towards nature, which was further reinforced with over 5
            years of work experience with Architectural organizations that encourage eco-friendly practices such as Dharmalaya
            Institute (Himachal Pradesh) and Hunnarshala Foundation (Gujarat).
            Her vast travels that spanned across different regions of India, most of which were tucked away in mountainous regions
            away from the concrete jungles of metro cities, sharpened her knowledge and strengthened her ecological perspective
            towards architecture and design. She seeks to integrate her learnings of sustainable approaches with the mainstream
            building industry for creating contextual and beautiful spaces that have a lesser impact on our environment.
